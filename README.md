# DataManipulator

A utility designed to take a data source and reorganize it based on a on column.

Built in large part to take data from the Canadian Government's Covid-19 csv file from
[here](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html) 
and provide a pivot table so that I could feed it to the charting functions in LinqPad.  This lets me create a table that contains 
the data from multiple provinces and contain them in a single table along side each other to better work with the requirements of the 
functions.
